         <h1>Cricket</h1>
         <h3><p>Cricket is a popular sport with a long history.
            It was invented in the 16th century in England,<br>
            but it was a long time before modern rules were used
            It is played between two teams of eleven players each. <br>
            One team, which is batting, tries to score runs,
            while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this.<br>
            Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a player
            from the fielding team to a player from the batting team,<br>
            across the boundary, or by the two batting players running 
            back-and-forth between the two wickets.</p></h3>
