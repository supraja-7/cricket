        <h3>The ICC Men's T20 World Cup (formerly the ICC World Twenty20) is the Twenty20 International cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2007.<br>
         The event has generally been held every two years. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018,
             with South Africa being the possible host,[2] but the ICC later dropped the idea of a 2018 edition as the top member nations<br>
              busied with bilateral commitments in 2018.[3] The 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place but due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
               the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) <br>
               and Omandue to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place 5 years after the previous (2016) iteration.</h3>
